# Angular Material Scratchpad
A very simple skeleton using angular-material.  May be used to help reproduce angular-material issues in addition to CodePen.

## Running the App
First, run npm install and bower install,
```
npm install
bower install
```

Then, you can start a simple server to host the  `src` directory,
```
npm start
```

By default the app is hosted at port `8080`, <http://localhost:8080>.
You can host the app on a different port (or pass any [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server#available-options) options)
as arguments to the script.  For example, to run the app on port 80,
```
npm start -- -p 80
```
